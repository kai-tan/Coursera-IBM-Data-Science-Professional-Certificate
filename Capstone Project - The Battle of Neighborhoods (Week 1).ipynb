    "### 1.1 Scenario and Background\n",
    "I am a student currently residing in Downtown, Singapore. I enjoy many ammenities in the neighborhood ,such as cousine restaurants, cafes, shopping mall, food shops and entertainment. Lets imagine that I have been offered a great opportunity to work in Toronto. Although, I am very excited about it, I am a bit stress toward the process to secure a comparable place to live in Toronto. Therefore, I decided to apply the learned skills during the Coursera course to explore ways to make sure my decision is factual and rewarding. Of course, there are alternatives to achieve the answer using available Google and Social media tools, but it rewarding doing it myself with learned tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem to be resolved:\n",
    "The challenge to resolve is being able to find a rental apartment unit in Toronto that offers similar characteristics and benefits to my current situation. Therefore, in order to set a basis for comparison, I want to find a renta unit subject to the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apartment with min 1 bedroom with monthly rent not to exceed US$4000/month\n",
    "Unit located within walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km) from a subway metro station in Toronto\n",
    "Area with ammenities and venues similar to the ones described for current location ( See item 2.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Interested Audience\n",
    "I believe this is a relevant project for a person or entity considering moving to Toronto or other major city, since the approach and methodologies used here are applicable in all cases. The use of FourSquare data and mapping techniques combined with data analysis will help resolve the key questions arisen. Lastly, this project is a good practical case toward the development of Data Science skills."

The actual algorythm coding may be shown in 'markdown' mode becasues it takes time to run.

The loop algorythms used are shown in the execution of data in section 3.0 \"Great_circle\" function from geolocator was used to calculate distances between two points , as in the case to calculate average rent price for units around each subway station and at 1.6 km radius.

I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area. Addresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim. Data will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro Toronto, etc.\n",
